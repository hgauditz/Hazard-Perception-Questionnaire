### Abstract
Visual-spatial navigation and hazard perception in post-stroke patients have been widely studied using virtual traffic environments. This thesis proposes an experimental paradigm to investigate hazard perception beyond traffic situations and towards a more general approach. The study consists of two parts: a questionnaire to capture behaviour and emotional reaction in various hazardous situations and a laboratory experiment where the perception of a moving robot during goal-directed walking is assessed by behavioural and physiological methods. The purpose of the experimental set-up is to create a near-daily life situation in which a small moving object interferes with the walking path of the subjects. The challenge for the participants is to recognize the robot as potential hazard, to correctly judge its speed and the risk of a collision, and, if necessary, to adjust their own walking to avoid a crash. Both parts of the study include a group of post-stroke patients and a neurologically healthy control group to compare hazard perception and to infer potential impairments following a stroke. The results of the questionnaire revealed no significant differences of the risk awareness between the groups. Nevertheless, stroke patients tend to show less risk-appetite due to more cautious behaviour and higher timidness in potentially dangerous situations compared to healthy control subjects. To draw robust conclusions, this effect needs to be further verified with a larger sample size. Due to time reasons, it was not possible to collect data for the experimental part. However, a similar tendency as given in the survey results is expected. Stroke patients are expected to show worse hazard perception skills, which will be assessed by eye-tracking, gait analyses and heart rate measurement. This combined experimental paradigm aims at investigating hazard perception in an overall approach and to understand the deficits in visual-spatial navigation following a stroke.
